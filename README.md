# Real_time_emotion_detection
This project aims to determine the emotion on a person's face in real time into one of seven categories, using deep convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.

The original FER-2013 data set can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X60B-uR3NtqPd4oosdotpbDgy8KOfUdr/view).
To work with it - 
Unzip the data into a folder containing dataset_prepare.py and run the python script. This will create four .npy files in the directory namely 'X_train', 'X_test', 'Y_train' and 'Y_test'. These are the prepared and shuffled numpy arrays which can be directly fed to the network.
